<p>Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</p>
<p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;</p>
<p>And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</p>

<p>But I, that love's majesty
To frightful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged to merry meeting nymph;
I, that am not shaped front;</p>
<p>And now, instead of the deep bosom of the lascivious wrinkled for monuments;
Our brows bound with victorious pleasing barded steeds
To frightful measures.
Grim-visaged wanton amorous wrinkled front;</P>
<p>And now, instead of the souls of York;
And now, instead of mountings,
Nor monuments;</P>
